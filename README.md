# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
To make a webpage where new bootcamp students could see a list of the topics we are studying and take notes in an organized and visually pleasing matter. It will make it easier to find all the information saved in one place under the topic it belongs to. I learned how to code HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages using Git, VS Code, and GitHub.

## Installation
n/a

## Usage
Webpage can be used as a refrence point for key points kept as notes in each of their respective topics. When DevTools console is running, it can be used to run JavaScript to randomly make a decision on which topic to study first.
